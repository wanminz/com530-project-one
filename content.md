Wanmin Zhang: Background and Ambitions

Hi everyone! My name is Wanmin Zhang. I am a 5th year (comes with a background story)
Information Technology & Management major here at Illinois Institute of Technology.
I also have a Communications minor. Going back to the very beginning, I was born
in a city near Hong Kong in Southern China. I moved here to Chicago when I was
six-years-old. My memories of my short childhood in China are very hazy.
