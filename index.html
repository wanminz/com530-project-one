Wanmin Zhang: Background and Ambitions

Hi everyone! My name is Wanmin Zhang. I am a 5th year (comes with a background story)
Information Technology & Management major here at Illinois Institute of Technology.
I also have a Communications minor. Going back to the very beginning, I was born
in a city near Hong Kong in Southern China. I moved here to Chicago when I was
six-years-old. My memories of my short childhood in China are very hazy. I mostly
remember growing up here in Chicago! I went to elementary, middle, and high school
here in Chicago and figured I should probably do the same for college as well.
That's how I ended up here at IIT!

This is a placeholder paragraph for my ambitions in this class.

This is another placeholder paragraph for my ambitions beyond IIT.
