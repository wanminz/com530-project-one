  <h1>Wanmin Zhang: Background and Ambitions</h1>
  <p>
    Hi everyone! My name is Wanmin Zhang. I am a 5th year (comes with a background
    story) Information Technology and Management major here at Illinois Institute of
    Technology. I also have a Communications minor. Going back to the very
    beginning, I was born in a city near Hong Kong in Southern China. I moved here
    to Chicago when I was six-years-old. My memories of my short childhood in China
    are very hazy. I mostly remember growing up here in Chicago! I went to
    elementary, middle, and high school here in Chicago and figured I should
    probably do the same for college as well. Thatâ€™s how I ended up here at IIT!

  <h2>Ambitions in COM530</h2>
  <p>
    For my last semester here at IIT before I graduate, I decided to take this
    course to top off the ITMD courses that I have taken with Dr. Stolley. I am
    hoping that Standards Based Web Design will allow me to grow more
    comfortable with my web development and design skills. I sincerely enjoy
    creating and writing for the web, and I hope that this class will be able to
    show myself that I am capable of doing so. I would also like to be able to
    get more creative with my web designs. I tend to stick to one color scheme
    or font combination and it tends to get boring. This is the first website I
    have written all by myself in a while and I am pretty proud of it!
