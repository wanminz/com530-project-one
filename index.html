  <h1>Wanmin Zhang: Background and Ambitions</h1>
  <p>
    Hi everyone! My name is Wanmin Zhang. I am a 5th year (comes with a background
    story) Information Technology and Management major here at Illinois Institute of
    Technology. I also have a Communications minor. Going back to the very
    beginning, I was born in a city near Hong Kong in Southern China. I moved here
    to Chicago when I was six-years-old. My memories of my short childhood in China
    are very hazy. I mostly remember growing up here in Chicago! I went to
    elementary, middle, and high school here in Chicago and figured I should
    probably do the same for college as well. Thatâ€™s how I ended up here at IIT!

    This is a placeholder paragraph for my ambitions in this class. According to
    all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. Its
    wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of
    course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is
    impossible. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh,
    black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little. Barry! Breakfast is ready!
    Coming! Hang on a second. Hello? - Barry? - Adam? - Can you believe this is
    happening? - I can't.

    This is another placeholder paragraph for my ambitions beyond IIT. I'll pick
    you up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for
    those. Sorry. I'm excited. Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you,
    son. A perfect report card, all B's. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going
    here. - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That's me! - Wave to us! We'll be
    in row 118,000. - Bye! Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house! - Hey,
    Adam. - Hey, Barry. - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation.
    Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school, three days high school.
