  <h1>Wanmin Zhang: Background and Ambitions</h1>
  <p>
    Hi everyone! My name is Wanmin Zhang. I am a 5th year (comes with a background story)
    Information Technology & Management major here at Illinois Institute of Technology.
    I also have a Communications minor. Going back to the very beginning, I was born
    in a city near Hong Kong in Southern China. I moved here to Chicago when I was
    six-years-old. My memories of my short childhood in China are very hazy. I mostly
    remember growing up here in Chicago! I went to elementary, middle, and high school
    here in Chicago and figured I should probably do the same for college as well.
    Thatâ€™s how I ended up here at IIT!
