  <h1>Wanmin Zhang: Background and Ambitions</h1>
  <p>
    Hi everyone! My name is Wanmin Zhang. I am a 5th year (comes with a background
    story) Information Technology and Management major here at Illinois Institute of
    Technology. I also have a Communications minor. Going back to the very
    beginning, I was born in a city near Hong Kong in Southern China. I moved here
    to Chicago when I was six-years-old. My memories of my short childhood in China
    are very hazy. I mostly remember growing up here in Chicago! I went to
    elementary, middle, and high school here in Chicago and figured I should
    probably do the same for college as well. That’s how I ended up here at IIT!
  </p>
  <h2>Ambitions in COM530</h2>
  <p>
    For my last semester here at IIT before I graduate, I decided to take this
    course to top off the ITMD courses that I have taken with Dr. Stolley. I am
    hoping that Standards Based Web Design will allow me to grow more
    comfortable with my web development and design skills. I sincerely enjoy
    creating and writing for the web, and I hope that this class will be able to
    show myself that I am capable of doing so. I would also like to be able to
    get more creative with my web designs. I tend to stick to one color scheme
    or font combination and it tends to get boring. This is the first website I
    have written all by myself in a while and I am pretty proud of it!
  </p>
  <h2>Ambitions Beyond IIT</h2>
  <p>
    As I mentioned above, I will be graduating in May so I hope my ambitions can
    become reality. To backtrack, I said I was a 5th year in my introduction
    paragraph. Entering college was a tough transition. I began as a bright-eyed
    Computer Science major. I soon realized the math it would require for me to
    reach the end and walk across the stage would be holding me back drastically.
    Thus, after a lot of thinking and discussions with advisors, I switched to
    Computer Information Systems. However, as I was still in my second year, my
    courses were still painfully similar to my Computer Science courses that I
    wasn’t doing so well in. After having stubbornly grasped at what seemed like
    a vanishing dream at becoming a successful programmer and moving to Silicon
    Valley, I finally let go of that and faced reality. The reality was that I
    was not very good at coding, nor was I a math genius. I felt stuck. I turned
    to ITM in a desperate attempt to remain hopeful that I would eventually find
    not only what I enjoyed to do, but what I was actually good at.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am very glad I made the decision to switch over to the ITM department.
    Learning web development skills was something I had forgotten I desired
    during the whirlwind of a journey of wanting to find something I could do.
    Now, I can’t say that I am a master at web development, but I would say
    I have come pretty far compared to when I first entered college. I hope that
    with all my skills that I have gathered in my imaginary toolbox along with
    Dr. Stolley’s knowledge imparted on me, I can begin a career in web
    development. Little by little, I am learning that it’s okay to be afraid of
    what comes next. No one is ever prepared for their next journey in life, but
    I can now say that I have found something that I enjoy doing, and that is
    web development.
